*Original Proposal (which will turn into the framework for my introduction*

How do we make lighting feel “live” again? As the technology for controlling lights has
advanced, the lighting design for shows has gotten more complicated, but all programmed
(save for some few spotlight operators). Although convenient, and necessary for
high-complexity shows, sometimes that design fails to feel “live”, and does not keep the
audience on the edge of their seat. Lighting, in its time-coded state, is not responsive to the
decisions made by the performer, thus some of the performer’s agency is taken away. When a performer needs to move in the beam of a moving light, they must pace themselves–every night–to make sure that they and the light are in sync. There has to be a better way, so that if the performer walks slower during the performance, the light slows to match. I want to deconstruct what “liveness” is, how I can reproduce it with software, and how I can give agency back to the performer.

I aim to create a software for show control which tracks a performer in a theatrical space, and trains a moving light onto the performer. There are some caveats. The software needs to be lightweight, and able to run on the average laptop computer. It must be open source, and publicly available for all to use and modify. Finally, the program needs to exist on top of
existing theatrical network architecture. My aim for this is to try and create technology that is accessible to productions with little budget.

Tracking a performer is not a new idea. There are numerous choices for lighting tracking
software, like CAST Group’s BLACKTRAX, Follow-Me©, and zactrack®. However, these
systems are often closed-source, prohibitively expensive, hardware intensive, or otherwise
difficult for small productions to access. The software developed during this thesis hopes to
try to make it easier to access. With this project comes deep research into the history of performance technology. I aim to look at how lighting control technology advanced over the previous ~50 years, and see how the changes affected what lighting meant for the stage. I also want to explore how this technology differs over productions of different sizes. I postulate that technology often “trickles down” from high-end productions (concert tours, sporting events, Broadway, etc.) to low-end, and most technology is manufactured for the arenas, concert venues, and other performance spaces who can pay the premium.

This project will culminate in a design that will be presented at Beier (Belle) Li’s Dance
Thesis. Belle’s thesis (which would be presented in the Spring semester) focuses on the
concept of “Mother” through three different lenses: Her own mother, her mother language,
and her mother country (Mandarin and China respectively). I believe that this specific
software would be prudent to use when Belle explores her mother country. It is not new
knowledge that China uses fairly invasive surveillance technology on its citizens, similar to
most economically powerful countries, and I believe that a design that utilizes live cameras to position a light can highlight that well. The current idea for this section is for Belle to carry a yellow umbrella, a symbol of the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement and the protests taking place in Hong Kong. Having a light attempting to track the umbrella / the person carrying it is an excellent allusion to the current state of surveillance that exists.

*"There is a living principle in lighting, second only to that of the actor himself"* - Hiram K. Moderwell

A dreaded moment for every lighting designer is when--during a show--a performer steps into a pool of light, and is only partially illuminated

Lighting is missing a certain magic or alchemy (see Anne Bogart's Magnetism)

How do we make lighting feel “live” again? As the technology for controlling lights has
advanced, the lighting design for shows has gotten more complicated, but all programmed
(save for some few spotlight operators). Although convenient, and necessary for
high-complexity shows, sometimes that design fails to feel “live”, and does not keep the
audience on the edge of their seat, save for the inevitable mistake. 

This thesis covers the creation process of show control software that tracks a performer in a theatrical space and trains a moving light onto them. This software is not a new concept in any means.

This thesis explores lighting control, specifically for live performance. It will take a look at how lighting was originally controlled manually, how the technology has advanced to today through the use of time coding, and proposes a system for control that is reactive to a performer. Lighting control has advanced at a breakneck speed over the past half-century as the world entered a digital age. Where lighting control rooms were packed with levers and room-scale dimming racks now sit lighting desks, or even just a laptop. As the technology for controlling lights has advanced, the lighting design for live performances has gotten more complicated, while being largely prerecorded. Thus, while a designer's vision is accomplished in collaboration with the director and performers, it stays static barring catastrophe.

This thesis attempts to create a lighting control scheme that tracks a performer through a theatrical space. It is a reactive scheme that hopes to meet a few criteria: 1) The scheme must be lightweight; 2) The scheme must be able to run using off-the-shelf components and computing resources; 3) The scheme must be open source; 4) The scheme should run on top of existing theater infrastructure.
