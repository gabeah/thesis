## A bunch of firsts:
"A pupil of Peruzzi, Serlio (1475-1554), built a theatre in Vicenza during the 1530s and in 1545 published *Architettura*, which describes contemporary theatrical methods. His drawings of a semicircular theatre with shallow perspective scenes are a part of theatre history" SLD (167)

"Gas lighting was first used in 1803 ... consisting of complicated mechanical cable controls to adjust flames and even color/special effects" (LF 203)
First electric lamp that debuted was a carbon-arc lamp presented in 1849 (" ")
First incandescent lamp debuted in 1885 ( " " )

First stage control unit appeared in 1888, created by the German electrical industry, it took advantage of rheostats (an electrical component which can adjust resistance in a circuit) and immersing cables, plates, and electrodes in salt pots ( " " )

## Proper electrical control:
Two major electrical control systems dominated the 1930's and beyond. That being the Bordoni and Salani control systems. Each were "variable rate transformers". The design shows multiple dials with levers. There were also intensity stops, and large wheels for group movement. (LF 207)

Electron tube control, widely adopted in the 1950's showcased the 2 banks of faders that we know and love (LF 207). First console in which the board and dimmers were separated was introduced in 1950

Early resistance dimmers were either done through plates or sliding, note Thyratron Reactor (MTL 115)

# Attempting to write a first chapter:

### Intro (yes again)
In this chapter, I present a comprehensive history of the technologies that controlled Lighting, and the theories posed by notable lighting designers when using the technology of the time. It is not a comprehensive history of Lighting Design as a whole, merely the technologies that enabled the designs throughout history. The first section will start out with the basic dousing technologies that obscured candles and oil lamps, and end with what the transition into incandescent lighting (1500's-1885). The second will go from the room-sized analogue control, through the advent of the desk lighting console, to just beyond the inception of Digital Multiplex. The third section will jump forward to the modern lighting designer, and what options are in-store for them. It will also discuss the idea of liveness, especially given the toolkit of the designer and the cost of theatre.
