## A bunch of firsts:
"Gas lighting was first used in 1803 ... consisting of complicated mechanical cable controls to adjust flames and even color/special effects" (LF 203)
First electric lamp that debuted was a carbon-arc lamp presented in 1849 (" ")
First incandescent lamp debuted in 1885 ( " " )

First stage control unit appeared in 1888, created by the German electrical industry, it took advantage of rheostats (an electrical component which can adjust resistance in a circuit) and immersing cables, plates, and electrodes in salt pots ( " " )

## Proper electrical control:
Two major electrical control systems dominated the 1930's and beyond. That being the Bordoni and Salani control systems. Each were "variable rate transformers". The design shows multiple dials with levers. There were also intensity stops, and large wheels for group movement. (LF 207)

Electron tube control, widely adopted in the 1950's showcased the 2 banks of faders that we know and love (LF 207). First console in which the board and dimmers were separated was introduced in 1950

Early resistance dimmers were either done through plates or sliding, note Thyratron Reactor (MTL 115)
