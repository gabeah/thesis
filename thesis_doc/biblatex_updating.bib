  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to introduce and quickly make a reader familiar with OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) basics without having to go through the lengthy reference manuals and books. OpenCV is an open source library for image and video analysis, originally introduced more than decade ago by Intel. Since then, a number of programmers have contributed to the most recent library developments. The latest major change took place in 2009 (OpenCV 2) which includes main changes to the C++ interface. Nowadays the library has {$>$}2500 optimized algorithms. It is extensively used around the world, having {$>$}2.5M downloads and {$>$}40K people in the user group. Regardless of whether one is a novice C++ programmer or a professional software developer, unaware of OpenCV, the main library content should be interesting for the graduate students and researchers in image processing and computer vision areas. To master every library element it is necessary to consult many books available on the topic of OpenCV. However, reading such more comprehensive material should be easier after comprehending some basics about OpenCV from this paper.},

It then reviews all current artificial lightsources, and comments on their suitability for control. A section on lighting control components covers electronic and electromagnetic dimmers, ballasts and transformers. The next section reviews lighting control systems, including those for stage and entertainment, architectural applications, energy management and building control; and includes a chapter on control signals protocols. The final part is an extensive applications review, fully illustrated, covering everything from hotels and cruise ships to homes and churches; and taking in offices, factories, simulators, trains and planes on the way.  Lighting Control: technology and applications brings together information not otherwise available from a single source. It is intended as a training resource within the lighting industry, both for those completely new to the subject, and for those coming to it from another technical field. It will also be useful for lighting designers, consulting engineers and electrical contractors as a reference book covering current and emerging lighting control techniques - with special emphasis on new light sources and new digital control standards. Information, case histories and illustrations for the book have been provided by many leading lighting companies and organizations in North America and Europe.},

The technique only requires the camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few (at least two) different orientations. Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved. The motion need not be known. Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed procedure consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique, and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques which use expensive equipment such as two or three orthogonal planes, the proposed technique is easy to use and flexible. It advances 3D computer vision one step from laboratory environments to real world use.},
