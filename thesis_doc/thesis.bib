	abstract = {Robert Simpson's comprehensive volume covers all aspects of lighting control systems. It starts with two foundation chapters outlining the basics of electricity, light and electronics as they apply to lighting control. It then reviews all current artificial lightsources, and comments on their suitability for control. A section on lighting control components covers electronic and electromagnetic dimmers, ballasts and transformers. The next section reviews lighting control systems, including those for stage and entertainment, architectural applications, energy management and building control; and includes a chapter on control signals protocols. The final part is an extensive applications review, fully illustrated, covering everything from hotels and cruise ships to homes and churches; and taking in offices, factories, simulators, trains and planes on the way.  Lighting Control: technology and applications brings together information not otherwise available from a single source. It is intended as a training resource within the lighting industry, both for those completely new to the subject, and for those coming to it from another technical field. It will also be useful for lighting designers, consulting engineers and electrical contractors as a reference book covering current and emerging lighting control techniques - with special emphasis on new light sources and new digital control standards. Information, case histories and illustrations for the book have been provided by many leading lighting companies and organizations in North America and Europe.},

Since then, a number of programmers have contributed to the most recent library developments. The latest major change took place in 2009 ({OpenCV} 2) which includes main changes to the C++ interface. Nowadays the library has {\textgreater}2500 optimized algorithms. It is extensively used around the world, having {\textgreater}2.5M downloads and {\textgreater}40K people in the user group. Regardless of whether one is a novice C++ programmer or a professional software developer, unaware of {OpenCV}, the main library content should be interesting for the graduate students and researchers in image processing and computer vision areas. To master every library element it is necessary to consult many books available on the topic of {OpenCV}. However, reading such more comprehensive material should be easier after comprehending some basics about {OpenCV} from this paper.},
